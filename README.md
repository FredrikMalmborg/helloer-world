the third

Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. The unexpected is our normal routine. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Computer, belay that order. Sorry, Data. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Your head is not an artifact! Travel time to the nearest starbase? I'll be sure to note that in my log. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately?
